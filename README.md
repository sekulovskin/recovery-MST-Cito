# **Internship project:** ***Recovery of early mistakes in multistage tests***

This repository contains all the `R` code used to answer the research question: *To what extent can students “recover” from mistakes made in earlier stage(s) and still reach an estimate close to their true ability?* I did this project for an internship at [Cito](https://www.cito.com/), from 10.1.2022 to 18.2.2022 as part of an elective for my Research Master's Programme.  
This repository contains the following folders:

- **Data:** Contains both the MST design rules, needed to repeat the simulation, as well as all the data produced by the simulations and the analyses presented in the report;
- **Functions:** Contains the functions for calculating the reference scores of each subject, as well as a function that classifies students in one of the classes of secondary education
- **Proposal:** Contains the proposal for the internship sent to the University;
- **Report:** Contains the markup manuscript for the report of this project;
- **scripits_mistakes:** Contains the `R` scripts written to calculate the number of mistakes in Modules A and on Day 1;
- **Simulation 1:** Contains the code needed to produce the simulated MST responses, and the code for the analyses presented in the report for the first simulation;
- **Simulation 2:**  Contains the code needed to produce the simulated MST responses, and the code for the analyses presented in the report for the first simulation.
